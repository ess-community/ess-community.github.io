# Creating a cyberinfrastructure that fully enables data management, cross-domain modeling, data analysis, and collaborative research to accelerate the iterative approach to scientific discovery.

The community-driven cyberinfrastructure for Biological and Environmental Research (BER) Environmental System Science (ESS) will be developed in phases by a dynamic and coordinated set of working groups with expertise in model development, data management, software engineering, and workflows for model-data integration.

There will be integration of these working groups across the Department of Energyâ€™s Terrestrial Ecosystem Science (TES) and Subsurface Biogeochemical Research (SBR) projects, with development in the broader Climate and Environmental Science Division (CESD) community and in external agencies.
