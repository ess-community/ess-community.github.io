A flexible and open cyberinfrastructure is needed for our community to address the challenges  we face in advancing Environmental System Science (ESS).   Several of these challenges are highlighted in the image below.  The working groups strive to enable all ESS projects, big or small, University or DOE-led to utilize common cyberinfrastructure tools and workflows in a culture of Open Science.

  Cyberinfrastructure underlies the ModEx workflows shown schematically in this figure. Ensuring these workflows are open, accessible, and transferable for the ESS community to use in their research is an important part of the ESS CI Working Groups mission.

Incredible technological changes are driving key aspects of the challenges highlighted in the figure, and how we address them as a community, including

  * New instrumentation/data acquisition capabilities such as
    distributed & fiber sensing, drones/remote sensing, 5G/satellite
    internet are changing the flow and management of data.
  * New technologies are available, such as Machine Learning, Big
    Data, Cloud & Edge Computing, Internet of Things, next generation
    CPU-GPU compute architectures.
  * Exascale computing is currently underutilized in mechanistic
    simulations, and there is limited use within ML workflows in our
    community.
  * Open Science by design should be embraced, for example, it will
    help support Interagency efforts to develop model testbeds require
    broader data sharing & model co-development

Join us in addressing these challenges as a community.
