## Mission / Objectives

The working groups strive to enable all ESS projects, big or small, University or DOE-led to utilize common cyberinfrastructure tools and workflows in a culture of Open Science.

## Background

</p>
The ESS Cyberinfrastructure Working Groups (CIWGs) were formed in
2016, based on recommendations of an exploratory workshop held in 2015
that examined common cyberinfrastructure needs across a range of ESS
projects.  The workshop report titled “Environmental System Science
Workshop on Model-Data Integration: Modeling Frameworks, Data
Management, and Scientific Workflows” has more details.  Based on this
report we launched three working groups, 
[Data Management](/working-groups/data-management), 
[Model Data Integration](/working-groups/integration), and 
[Software Engineering and
Interoperability](/working-groups/software-engineering).  
Since then we have regularly held an annual meeting, usually preceding the
ESS PI Meeting that brought the members of the community together to
explore opportunities and challenges for cyberinfrastructure that is
needed to support ESS research.  These meetings proved to be very
popular, increasing awareness and collaboration across projects, labs
and agencies.  These meetings also introduced new ways of approaching
these challenges, including the meeting in 2018 where staged a one-day
design thinking challenge taught by Kate Maher and Matt Rothe from the
Stanford Design Thinking Program.  We continue to use several
techniques from this workshop throughout the development of our near
and long-term goals as well as interagency collaborations.

Shortly after we began, we drafted a vision paper based on the current
status of cyberinfrastructure in ESS.  In particular, this report from
2016, titled “Towards a Shared ESS Cyberinfrastructure: Vision and
First Steps”, that focused on our gaps in data management and how
addressing those gaps could support the long term goals of ModEx or
the Virtual Laboratory.  Thus, the near and long-term vision focused
on the need for an open and FAIR data archive with forward looking
features that would eventually enable its seamless interaction with
ModEx workflows for model data integration and analysis.  This report
played an important role framing some of the features and
characteristics of ESS-DIVE, which has emerged as our community’s
primary open and FAIR data archive.

Recently we began to work on a new white paper that would update this
vision.  While we had hoped to finish that paper a year ago, we will
strive to finish it this summer.  Thus far it is clear that new
technologies and growing expectations for ESS science are creating new
challenges.  To address those challenges we need continue to support
existing efforts around Data Management and our collaborations with
ESS-DIVE, and we need to expand our efforts in workflows around data
model integration, including capabilities for new AI/ML approaches, as
well as new data streams for input and evaluation, as well as more
full archiving and utilizing output from models.  In addition, the
rapidly increasing diversity and power of computing motivated the
creation of a fourth working group on
[Computing Infrastructure](/working-groups/computing-infrastructure).  
This working group will ensure that we are addressing the increasingly diverse computing needs of the community, including edge computing, options for cloud services, support for mid-range high performance computing CPU-based systems, and the transition to heterogeneous CPU/GPU based systems.
