The rapid and disruptive changes in computing hardware are creating
new opportunities and new challenges for environmental system science.
For example, many DOE facilities are investing heavily in GPU-based
HPC resources, while many of our community simulation codes and
related tools have not been refactored to take advantage of GPUs.
Similarly, new sensor technologies, sensor arrays, and edge computing
are creating new opportunities to automate the collection of
environmental data.  However, our community is only beginning to
explore these technologies.  The **Computing Infrastructure (CI) working
group** strives to ensure the community has the computing resources it
needs, whether itâ€™s providing additional mid-range computing resources
to provide more time for the community to adjust to GPU-based systems,
or helping demonstrate new workflows for new data streams.

  The Tahoma supercomputer at the Environmental Molecular Sciences
  Laboratory (EMSL) at the Pacific Northwest Laboratory provides a
  balance of mid-range CPU based computing with some GPU acclerated
  nodes. Ensuring ESS scientists have access to the balance of
  resources that meet their needs is critical.
