Rapid and disruptive changes in computing hardware combined with innovative machine learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications are creating new opportunities and new challenges for biological and environmental system science. Mid-range, high-performance computing systems have an important role in providing the research community with hardware that meets their diverse computing needs including: the GPUs that are essential for running advanced ML algorithms, which require significant computational power; and the memory and data storage capacity to facilitate AI integration of diverse data sources, such as remote sensing, molecular data, and model simulations. DOE BER supported compute systems enable the innovative ML and AI approaches that will discover patterns and insights that are critical to advance biological and environmental research.

The **Computing Infrastructure (CI) working group** strives to connect the research community with computing resources, introduce researchers to the advanced tools and support available to them, and to coordinate with the other working groups to keep up with emerging computing requirements and demonstrate workflows for new data streams.
