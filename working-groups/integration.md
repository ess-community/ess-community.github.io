The Model Data Integration (MDI) Working Group has facilitated
communication among ESS researchers and with the wider research
community since its inception at the 2016 ESS Cyberinfrastructure
Working Group Meeting. Our working group focuses

  * model-data integration workflows
  * modelâ€“data comparisons
  * model evaluation and benchmarking

More specifically, we are interested in uncertainty quantification and data assimilation,
managing model results and observational data (in collaboration with the Data Management
Working Group), geospatial and remote sensing data analysis,
traditional and machine learning-based data analytics, and building
hybrid models that combines process-based models with data-driven
models.

  The ModEx cycle motivates the need for a common cyberinfrastructure that can provide
  flexible workflow and analysis capabilties to the community.

Our working group has identified major challenges and
opportunities in MDI from community feedback to a 2021
questionnaire. A summary is provided figure MDI.
