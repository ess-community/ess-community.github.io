Software plays several critical roles in environmental system science,
from the tools that comprise complicated workflows for model data
integration and analysis to the underlying computational engine that
provides the physics-based simulations. Increasingly we think of this
collection of tools and codes as a software ecosystem (shown
schematically below) of flexible and interoperable components that
supports the ModEx cycle, and can readily leverage advances in
AI/ML. However, realizing this scientific capacity for the community
requires that we avoid ad hoc and one off solutions and support the
underlying software as a fundamental community resource, following
best practices in software development methodologies and providing
education and training.  To this end, the SEI working group explores

 * integration of legacy and new capabilities across projects
 * best practices for software development and release
 * rigorous – but rapid – testing and validation of model-data integration capabilities
 * changing architectures and programming models
 * deployments of workflows and simulation codes in containers and using cloud resources.
 * complex multiscale models (coupling, interoperability)
 * performing quantitative and formalized UQ
 * supporting AI/ML enhanced workflows
 * diverse interdisciplinary teams, and training
 * increased scientific productivity

  <figcaption>The IDEAS-Watersheds Software Ecosystem includes primary codes that are used and developed by that project, as well as third party codes that it uses but doesn't contribute to.  Similarly it includes both primary and third party workflow tools.  To promote reuse and code sharing they are also developing common interfaces, such as the Alquimia interface to different biogechemistry engines (i.e., PFLOTRAN and CrunchFlow).</figcaption>
