Data Management is central to virtually all aspects of Environmental
System Science and the ModEx cycle. Specifically it must provide tools
and workflows that support the archival of rapidly growing diverse
data streams from the field, informing model representations with
archived data, as well as workflows for model data integration and
analysis.  ESS-DIVE envisions becoming the repository of choice for
archiving data generated by ESS projects, enabling the use of data in
support of the DOEâ€™s Data-Model Integration Grand Challenge and
Virtual Laboratory vision (U.S. DOE 2018, U.S. DOE 2015) and
ultimately knowledge generation.  However, assessing the data
management needs and priorities of the community is challenging, yet
it must drive priorities in ESS-DIVE development.  The objective of
the **Data Management (DM) working group** is to work with the ESS
Community to ensure their short and long-term needs are met by
ESS-DIVE in conjunction with other archival and distribution services,
such as ESGF.  Thus the DM working group will explore

  * Data Preservation, Sharing, and Publication
  * Common Data and Metadata Standards
  * Data Citation and Attribution
  * Data Federation across different data catalogs
  * Data Synthesis across ESS and other relevant Datasets
  * Development of common Tools for data usage 
  * QA/QC, processing, analysis, mining and visualization data to prepare them for use in new research projects.
