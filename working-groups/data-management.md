**Data Management (DM) Working Group** addresses data needs of the ESS Community:

* Data Preservation, Sharing, and Publication
* Common Data and Metadata Standards
* Data Citation and Attribution
* Data Federation across different data catalogs
* Data Synthesis across ESS and other relevant data sources
* Development of common Tools for data usage
* QA/QC, processing, analysis, mining and visualizing data to prepare them for use, especially in new research applications such as AI.

The **Data Management Working Group** collaborates with members of the ESS Community 
by providing opportunities to interact with each other through quarterly and annual 
meetings to ensure their short and long-term needs are met at ESS-DIVE and other DOE 
data type specific repositories (i.e. ESGF, EMSL, JGI, AmeriFlux). The opportunity for 
cross-project/institution/discipline interaction of our many forward-looking members 
is invaluable since data management is central to virtually all aspects of Environmental 
System Science and the ModEx cycle. By establishing shared, standard tools and workflows, 
the archival of the rapidly-growing, diverse data is facilitated. These archived data 
will inform model representations of environmental systems, and the model results and 
analyses should guide future data collections. Towards these goals, ESS-DIVE is the primary 
repository for archiving data generated by ESS projects following the guidance and 
requirements of the [2023 DOE Public Access Plan](https://doi.org/10.11578/2023DOEPublicAccessPlan)
and the DOE Office of Science [Statement on Digital Management](https://science.osti.gov/Funding-Opportunities/Digital-Data-Management).
