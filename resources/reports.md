	A one day meeting of the Executive Committee was held in 2016 to identify challenges and gaps in data archival for the ESS Community.  The report details these gaps and presents a vision and approach for providing these critical services to the community, and advancing a shared community cyberinfrastructure.

	This report derives from the March 2023 Artificial Intelligence for the Methane Cycle (AI4CH4) virtual work-shop, co-organized by staff from the Earth and Environmental Systems Sciences Division (EESSD), within the U.S. Department of Energy Biological and Environmental Research program (BER), and computational ecologist Dr. Pamela Weisenhorn from Argonne National Laboratory. AI4CH4 provides a follow-up to the 2021 Artificial Intelligence for Earth System Predictability workshop series (ai4esp.org) co-organized by two DOE programs—BER and Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR).

	This report derives from a October 2022 request for information on the Biological and Environmental Research (BER) program within the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science which supports large-scale data generation efforts across its two divisions: Biological Systems Science and Earth and Environmental Systems Sciences. The review was presented at the Fall BERAC meeting in 2023 and helped to secure future funding.

	In October 2021, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) welcomed participants to the Artificial Intelligence for Earth System Predictability (AI4ESP) Workshop, hosted by the Office of Biological and Environmental Research (BER)—Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR).
	<br><br>
	A distinguishing aspect of this workshop was the framing around BER’s “Model-Experimentation” (ModEx) integrative research process, which involves integrating observations, experiments, and measurements, performed in the field or laboratory, with model research that simulates these same processes.
