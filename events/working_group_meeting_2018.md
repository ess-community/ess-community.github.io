# Motivation/Objectives

The overaching goal of this meeting is to explore ways to tap into the passion and potential of the community, to breakdown stovepipes, and to empower interdisciplinary teams to acclerate ESS science through advances in community cyberinfrastructure.  For most of the day we will embark on a cross-cutting design challenge to foster communication and collaboration in new ways, to build our capacity in understanding user needs and to amplify user engagement to develop usable data tools, models and software. This design challenge will enable each of us to overcome the barriers and misconceptions that have challenged our effective use of, and contribution to, community resources. Thus, the goal is to not only leverage and contribute to current R&D efforts more effectively, but also to identify and drive new areas that can accelerate scientific innovation using new collaborative models and partnerships.

This custom design challenge training course was developed by experts in design thinking
